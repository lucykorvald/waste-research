# waste-research
My Phd research project on individual norms, recycling, and source reduction. 

I use 6 waves of nationally representative survey data on Europeans' attitude toward the environment and annual packaging waste data across EU member states fromo Eurostat. 

(More details about each variable and the panel linear models will be updated...)
